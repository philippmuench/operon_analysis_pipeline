# Operon Conservation Analysis Methods

## Genome Annotation

Prior to homology searches, all bacterial genome assemblies were annotated using Prokka version 1.14.6 to ensure consistent gene prediction and annotation across the dataset. We processed 8,587 *Enterococcus faecalis* genome assemblies obtained from public databases, with each genome annotated using species-specific parameters (--kingdom Bacteria --genus Enterococcus --species faecalis). The annotation pipeline achieved a 100% success rate, generating eight output files per genome (GFF, FAA, FFN, FNA, GBK, TSV, TXT, and LOG formats) for comprehensive downstream analyses.

Prokka annotation quality was consistent across the dataset, with genomes averaging 2,821 predicted genes (median 2,800, range 2,391-3,728, SD 201). This narrow distribution with no significant outliers confirmed the high quality of the input assemblies and annotation process. In total, 24,222,330 genes were predicted across all genomes, indicating that the absence of genes present in 100% of genomes reflects genuine biological diversity rather than technical artifacts or annotation failures.

## Reference Operon Sequence Extraction

Reference sequences for homology searches were extracted from a curated GenBank file (8,082 bp) containing the complete fructoselysine/glucoselysine utilization operon from *Enterococcus faecalis*. This seven-gene operon encodes a complete pathway for the utilization of advanced glycation end products through a phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS).

The operon consists of seven protein-coding genes arranged in the following order: *frpC* (fructoselysine-6-phosphate deglycase), *glpC* (glucoselysine-6-phosphate deglycase), *ptsD* (PTS system IID component), *ptsC* (PTS system IIC component), *ptsB* (PTS system IIB component), *ptsA* (PTS system IIA component), and *fruR* (sigma-54 dependent transcriptional regulator). Additionally, two regulatory elements were identified: the operon promoter region and the Pribnow box (-10 consensus sequence).

Sequence extraction was performed using BioPython to parse the GenBank format and extract both nucleotide and amino acid sequences. All genes in this operon are encoded on the complement strand and were appropriately reverse-complemented during extraction. The extraction process generated multiple query sequence sets: 7 protein sequences (average length 352 amino acids, range 154-919 residues, total 2,461 residues), 7 nucleotide gene sequences (average length 1,058 bp, range 465-2,760 bp, total 7,404 bp), and 2 regulatory nucleotide sequences for non-coding elements (average length 289 bp, total 578 bp).

These reference sequences were formatted as FASTA files with standardized headers containing locus tags, gene names, and functional annotations. The resulting query sets provided comprehensive coverage of both coding and regulatory elements necessary for identifying complete operon homologs across diverse bacterial genomes in subsequent BLAST searches.

## BLAST-based Homology Search

We employed a multi-strategy BLAST search approach to comprehensively identify operon homologs across bacterial genomes. Reference sequences for the seven-gene operon (frpC, glpC, ptsD, ptsC, ptsB, ptsA, fruR) were extracted from the *Enterococcus faecalis* V583 genome and used as queries in four complementary search strategies.

The reference query set comprised 7 protein sequences and 9 nucleotide sequences (7 coding sequences plus 2 non-coding regulatory elements including the promoter region). BLAST searches were performed against 8,287 prokaryotic genomes using NCBI BLAST+ version 2.12.0 with default parameters except where noted.

For protein-based searches, we used tblastn to align the 7 reference protein sequences against genomic nucleotide sequences (.fna files) from Prokka-annotated genomes. This approach enabled detection of homologous genes regardless of annotation quality, with an E-value threshold of 1×10⁻⁵. To validate findings and capture nucleotide-level conservation patterns, we performed complementary blastn searches using the corresponding nucleotide sequences as queries against the same genomic targets.

To generate sequence variants suitable for phylogenetic analysis, we implemented a third strategy where Prokka-predicted coding sequences (.ffn files) from each genome were searched against a nucleotide database constructed from our reference operon genes using blastn with a minimum identity threshold of 80%. This approach captured query sequence fragments (qseq) that reflect the actual sequence diversity present in the target genomes.

Finally, we searched for non-coding regulatory elements using blastn to align promoter and regulatory sequences against genomic nucleotide sequences, enabling identification of conserved regulatory motifs upstream of operon genes.

Across all search strategies, we generated 473,867 BLAST hits, of which 55,826 (15.8%) met high-quality criteria (≥90% sequence identity and ≥80% query coverage). The mean sequence identity across all hits was 43.4% with 94.5% mean query coverage, indicating broad phylogenetic distribution of operon homologs with varying degrees of conservation.

For each genome and query gene combination, we retained only the highest-scoring hit based on bitscore to avoid redundancy. Both DNA strands were searched automatically by BLAST, with reverse complement matches identified by coordinate order (sstart > send). This comprehensive search strategy ensured robust detection of operon components across diverse bacterial lineages while capturing the sequence variation necessary for downstream phylogenetic and conservation analyses.

Multiple sequence alignments were generated using MAFFT version 7.490 with automatic algorithm selection, and temporary files were directed to high-performance local storage (/vol/tmp) to optimize computational efficiency during large-scale alignment operations.

## Core Gene Analysis

To establish a baseline for evaluating operon gene conservation, we performed comprehensive core gene analysis across all annotated *E. faecalis* genomes. Core genes were defined as those present in ≥95% of genomes, representing the conserved genetic backbone of the species that could serve as a reference for comparison with the more variable operon genes.

Core gene identification was performed by parsing all Prokka-generated GFF annotation files to extract gene names and calculate prevalence statistics across the 8,587 genome dataset. This analysis identified 5,540 unique genes across all genomes, with 1,251 genes meeting the ≥95% prevalence threshold for core gene designation. Notably, no genes were present in 100% of genomes, reflecting genuine genomic diversity within *E. faecalis* rather than annotation artifacts, as confirmed by the consistent gene count distribution (2,816 ± 200 genes per genome) with no significant outliers. The highest prevalence genes achieved ≥99% presence (1,071 genes), representing the most highly conserved genetic elements of the species.

For each core gene, nucleotide sequences were extracted from Prokka annotations across all genomes where the gene was present, yielding an average of 7,693 sequences per gene (range dependent on gene prevalence). The extracted sequences averaged 987 bp in length (range 171-2,340 bp), reflecting the diversity of core gene functions from small regulatory genes to large metabolic enzymes.

Multiple sequence alignments were generated for all 1,280 core genes using MAFFT with automatic algorithm selection and parallel processing for computational efficiency. The resulting alignments averaged 1,095 positions in length and contained an average of 7,709 sequences per alignment, providing robust datasets for conservation analysis.

Conservation analysis was performed using Shannon entropy-based scoring, where conservation scores range from 0 (highly variable) to 1 (perfectly conserved). The core genes exhibited high overall conservation with a mean score of 0.931, confirming their fundamental importance to *E. faecalis* biology. Conservation analysis revealed that 935 genes (73.0%) were highly conserved (score ≥0.9), 273 genes (21.3%) were moderately conserved (0.7-0.9), and only 72 genes (5.6%) showed lower conservation scores. The most conserved genes included essential ribosomal proteins (50S ribosomal protein L36 *rpmJ*, translation initiation factor IF-1 *infA*, 30S ribosomal protein S21 *rpsU*, 30S ribosomal protein S13 *rpsM*, 50S ribosomal protein L17 *rplQ*; all with scores ≥0.999), while the least conserved core genes included dipeptide-binding protein variants (*dppE_2*, *dppE_5*, *dppE_6*, *dppE_4*; scores 0.519-0.525) and a tyrosine recombinase XerC (*xerC_3*; score 0.423). Mean pairwise sequence identity across core genes was 0.924, with an average gap percentage of 8.2% in alignments.

This comprehensive core gene analysis established the baseline conservation patterns for essential *E. faecalis* genes, against which the conservation of the fructoselysine/glucoselysine operon genes could be compared to assess their relative evolutionary constraint and functional importance within the species.

## Operon Sequence Extraction and Multiple Sequence Alignment

Following the comprehensive BLAST-based homology searches described above, we implemented a sequence extraction pipeline to retrieve actual operon gene sequences from genomic assemblies using the pre-computed BLAST coordinates. This approach leveraged the existing search results to extract high-quality sequences for phylogenetic and conservation analyses without re-running computationally expensive BLAST operations.

Sequence extraction was performed using a coordinate-based mapping system that translated BLAST hit positions from the previous step to genomic coordinates in both Prokka-annotated genomes and raw assemblies. Quality filtering was applied with stringent thresholds of ≥90% sequence identity and ≥80% query coverage to ensure high-quality homologs while capturing meaningful sequence diversity. The extraction pipeline automatically handled strand orientation, performing reverse complementation for genes identified on the negative strand (indicated by sstart > send coordinates in BLAST output).

Four complementary extraction strategies were employed to comprehensively evaluate the impact of different data sources and search approaches on downstream analyses. Strategy A employed tblastn (protein-to-nucleotide) mapping against Prokka-annotated genome files, providing high-confidence gene identification through amino acid sequence homology while benefiting from consistent gene boundary definitions. Strategy B used blastn (nucleotide-to-nucleotide) searches against the same Prokka genome files to capture nucleotide-level conservation patterns with precise gene annotations. Strategy C extracted sequence variants from Prokka-predicted coding sequences using blastn against a reference database, recovering query sequence fragments that reflect actual sequence diversity in target genomes. Strategy D employed tblastn mapping directly against raw genomic assemblies, bypassing annotation-dependent gene boundaries to capture authentic genomic sequences as they exist in the original assemblies.

While Strategy A (Prokka-based tblastn) was utilized for gene boundary analysis and validation due to its reliance on consistent annotation frameworks, Strategy D (assembly-based tblastn) was selected as the primary approach for downstream phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses. This choice was motivated by several critical advantages: (1) direct extraction from source assemblies eliminates potential annotation artifacts that could bias evolutionary inference, (2) tblastn searches maintain sensitivity to detect homologs even in the presence of minor sequencing errors or frameshifts common in draft assemblies, (3) extracted sequences represent the actual genomic DNA that underwent evolutionary processes rather than computationally predicted gene models, and (4) this approach provides the most authentic sequence data for calculating evolutionary parameters such as dN/dS ratios and phylogenetic relationships.

Across all extraction strategies, the pipeline processed 16,574 BLAST result files, with 32.6% of BLAST hits meeting the stringent quality thresholds of ≥90% sequence identity and ≥80% query coverage (mean sequence identity of 55.0% and mean query coverage of 94.2% across all hits). The extraction yielded 28 sequence files containing approximately 6,000 sequences per operon gene on average, providing comprehensive datasets for each of the seven operon genes (*frpC*, *glpC*, *ptsD*, *ptsC*, *ptsB*, *ptsA*, *fruR*) and non-coding regulatory elements.

Multiple sequence alignments were generated for all extracted sequences using MAFFT version 7.490 with automatic algorithm selection optimized for each sequence type and size. The alignment pipeline created 36 separate MSAs across all strategies for coding genes and non-coding regulatory regions, with coding gene alignments maintaining reading frame integrity for subsequent evolutionary analyses. The resulting alignments averaged 1,048 positions in length and contained an average of 6,429 sequences per alignment.

Conservation analysis was performed on the resulting alignments using Shannon entropy-based scoring to quantify positional conservation across sequences. This approach enabled identification of functionally critical regions within operon genes and provided the foundation for comparing operon gene conservation against the established core gene baseline. Visualization outputs included gene-specific conservation plots and enhanced promoter analysis highlighting regulatory elements such as the Pribnow box (-10 consensus sequence).
