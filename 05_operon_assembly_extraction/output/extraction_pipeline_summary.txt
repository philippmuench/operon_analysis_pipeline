Operon Extraction Pipeline Summary
==================================
Execution Date: Tue Aug 19 21:22:14 CEST 2025
Job ID: 8905274
Execution Time: Tue Aug 19 21:22:14 CEST 2025

Input Data Sources:
- BLAST results: ../03_blast_search/output/blast_results/
- Complete BLAST hits: ../03_blast_search/output/all_blast_hits_complete.csv

Results Generated:
- BLAST analysis results: 0
- Promoter MSAs: 1
- Conservation plots: 49
- Promoter sequences: 8286

Pipeline Steps Completed:
1. ✅ Real gene sequence extraction from assemblies
2. ✅ Multiple Sequence Alignment creation (DNA & protein)
3. ✅ Promoter analysis from BLAST
4. ✅ Enhanced promoter plots with Pribnow box
5. ✅ BLAST-based diversity analysis (supplementary)

Next Steps:
- Use MSAs in ../06_diversity_analysis/ for conservation analysis
- Compare operon conservation with core genes from ../04_core_gene_analysis/
- Proceed to dN/dS analysis in ../07_dnds_analysis/
